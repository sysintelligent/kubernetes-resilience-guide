# The 12 Factors of Kubernetes Resilience

A comprehensive guide for building downtime-tolerant applications in Kubernetes environments. This repository contains detailed documentation, examples, and best practices for achieving 99.9%+ availability through systematic resilience patterns.

## üìñ What's Inside

This guide presents **The 12 Factors of Kubernetes Resilience**‚Äîa methodology inspired by the 12-Factor App approach, specifically designed for Kubernetes environments. Each factor addresses critical aspects of application resilience:

| Factor | Name | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **I** | Replicated Workloads | Eliminate single points of failure | Critical |
| **II** | Health Monitoring | Detect and recover from failures | Critical |
| **III** | Resource Management | Prevent resource exhaustion | Critical |
| **IV** | Graceful Lifecycle | Manage pod startup and shutdown | High |
| **V** | Topology Distribution | Survive infrastructure failures | High |
| **VI** | Auto-Scaling | Handle traffic spikes and failures | High |
| **VII** | Disruption Protection | Protect during planned maintenance | High |
| **VIII** | Configuration Resilience | Manage configuration changes safely | Medium |
| **IX** | Storage Resilience | Protect data and state | Medium |
| **X** | Network Resilience | Control traffic and communication | Medium |
| **XI** | Security Resilience | Prevent security-related failures | Medium |
| **XII** | Application Resilience | Handle application-level failures | Advanced |

## üöÄ Quick Start

For teams beginning their resilience journey, the guide includes a comprehensive, production-ready configuration that implements multiple factors. See the [main guide](downtime-tolerant-kubernetes.md) for complete implementation details.
